### Abstract (LIAM):

We are concerned with GHG emissions and the drastic effects it will have on our climate. This matters to us as within our lifetime we will be facing the damaging effects the climate crisis. To address our concern, we plan to use COVID-19 pandemic and the short drop in GHG emissions which followed as an example to how we can reduce our carbon footprint in the future.

**Keywords:** greenhouse gases, COVID-19, pandemic, climate change, lockdown

### Introduction (JUSTIN):

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought massive change to the modern world. Lockdown restrictions intended to stem the spread of this disease saw fewer people driving, traveling and consuming, and more people isolating at home, rarely leaving. During the early waves of the pandemic we also saw temporary closures of large industrial centers, and a massive migration to remote, or online, work. Through our research, we plan to determine what effect, if any, these changes to modern life have had on both global and national greenhouse gas emissions. This collected data, once analyzed, has the capacity to show us what potential steps can be taken to curb future greenhouse gas emissions, and serve as a real-world display of what both minute and drastic changes in normal life can do to the environment.

### Research Questions (JUSTIN + EVERYBODYS QUESTIONS):

_(REMOVE LATER) 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? See the Deign Brief, section B.4. (about 150 words)_

##### TODO (REMOVE LATER):
 1. Answer these questions for your question: What  motivates  these  questions?  Why  are  these  questions  important?  Generally,  how will you address them?

##### Questions (REMOVE LATER):

* MAIN QUESTION: What can we learn from GHG emissions data gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the restrictions and lockdowns put in place to use in the future to effectively help bring down GHG emissions? Did the COVID-19 lockdowns even make a noticeable difference in GHG emissions?

I realized that these first two questions are more than a little bit vague, so I'm gonna add some pointers here for you guys.

1. By COVID restrictions I meant lockdowns, air-land travel restrictions, businesses transitioning to online (less commuters), etc.
2. For datasets, I would focus first on transportation which will be where COVID restrictions lowered GHG the most, then onto increased utility (power, etc.) usage which is where COVID restrictions will have worsened GHG emissions the most.

* How did COVID restrictions impact GHG emissions on a state-by-state basis? - **Tom**
   * Total GHG emissions reported generally went down in the year 2020 compared to 2019 across the country, but in states like Washington or Illinois we saw a greater decline (if even) than states like Florida whoâ€™s total GHG emissions barely moved by the year. This could be a direct relation to the way different states handled lockdown during the pandemic.

* How did COVID restrictions worldwide affect GHG emissions? - **Ryan**
  * Ryan, I suggest finding 3 countries with varying economic levels (developed, developing, low development, ex. Germany, Brazil, Vietnam), also be aware of the size difference of the countries you'll be comparing. This question is important in making our paper appear less W.E.I.R.D.


* Did COVID make any significant change in the amount of pollution, compared to 'ideal' 0 GHG emissions models? How much pollution was actually prevented compared to pre-pandemic models of pollution?
  * This question mainly serves as a counter-argument to our other questions and will provide some validity to our claims. It will be useful to have a rough idea of how effective we can expect any ideas we come up from evaluating COVID restrictions can reasonably be. We will address this question by directly comparing GHG emission models with real world GHG emission data collected during the pandemic.


* How much GHG emissions have been prevented due to shutdown of factories worldwide?
  * COVID has closed many large industrial centers. It will be valuable to discover what effect their closures have had on global emissions, and can model cleaner manufacturing

### The Dataset (LIAM + EVERYBODYS DATA):

* Who or what is represented in the data?
* What is an observation? What variables are included (and excluded)?  
* Who  collected  the  data?  When?  For  what  purpose?  How  was  the  data  collection  effort
funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money?
* How was the data validated and held secure?  Is it credible and trustworthy?  
* How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data?

EPA Air Emissions Dataset
* This dataset contains approx. 8 millions entries of specific greenhouse gas types, emissions levels and locations across the united states from 2011 to 2020. The dataset was gathered from EPA monitoring systems and devices on the continental United states.

European Environment Agency Industrial Reporting database
* Dataset contains data pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions in participating European countries from 2010-2021, on a national, sector, and facility level. The data was gathered from EEA monitoring systems and devices in participating European countries.

Global Carbon Budget 2021
* The dataset contains fossil fuel emissions (CO2 mainly) dating from 1959 to 2021. Rows from the dataset are in MtC/yr (million tonne of carbon per year), with recorded features being types different ways of emission (Oil, Gas, etc.) and the country of origin. The data was collected from NOAA and a U.S. DOE organization, this data was funded by government programs and as such isn't profit focused. I believe this dataset was created primarily for climate researchers. The data is credible as it comes directly from a scientific journal (Earth System Science Data) and the Global Carbon Project which authored the report which collected and cleaned this data is a partner of United Nation's World Climate Research Programme.

IPCC AR5 WGIII Database
* This dataset contains models from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) dating from 2015. The models used mostly date from 2005-2100 and contain measurements in Mt CO2/yr, Mt CH4/yr, etc. as well as population and GDP estimates, in addition the data is sorted by region ASIA, NA, SA, etc. These models were created from the United Nation's IPCC and as such guarantees that the dataset with created with a non-profit focus, with the purpose of being used in IPCC's annual climate report. This data is credible as it originates from the United Nations.

### Expected Implications (TOM):
* With the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a decrease/downtrend in total greenhouse gas emissions outputted. The expected implications of this are that policymakers will be able to see that with dramatic global shutdown, minimizing the direct emissions into our atmosphere is very possible on a large scale. The obvious problem however is that life will not be in lockdown forever, but this temporary period may give some insight for a further permanent solution in decreasing emissions. By taking a deeper look into which and where certain emissions experienced drastic change, it may be possible to pinpoint or target a specific area/region to prioritize first for maximum efficiency when trying to tackle the issues.

### Limitations (TOM):
* The limitations to this study would be that we can only work with the provided data on record. Also, this data for reported GHG emissions is exactly that: reported. Therefore, although the data is as accurate as we have possible, it is most likely not exactly reflective of the true GHG emissions experienced.
