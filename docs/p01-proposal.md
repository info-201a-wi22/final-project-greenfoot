### Abstract:

We are concerned with GHG emissions and the drastic effects it will have on our climate. This matters to us as within our lifetime we will be facing the damaging effects the climate crisis. To address our concern, we plan to use COVID-19 pandemic and the short drop in GHG emissions which followed as an example to how we can reduce our carbon footprint in the future.

**Keywords:** greenhouse gases, COVID-19, pandemic, climate change, lockdown

### Introduction:

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought massive change to the modern world. Lockdown restrictions intended to stem the spread of this disease saw fewer people driving, traveling and consuming, and more people isolating at home, rarely leaving. During the early waves of the pandemic we also saw temporary closures of large industrial centers, and a massive migration to remote, or online, work. Through our research, we plan to determine what effect, if any, these changes to modern life have had on both global and national greenhouse gas emissions. This collected data, once analyzed, has the capacity to show us what potential steps can be taken to curb future greenhouse gas emissions, and serve as a real-world display of what both minute and drastic changes in normal life can do to the environment.

### Design Situation:

Our topic of concern is the amount of green house gas emissions, because all of us are concerned with trying to mitigate the affects of climate change. We will look at how GHG emissions decreased temporarily because of restrictions relating to Covid-19, and see what we can learn from that decrease in emissions. This problem domain falls under researching emissions and the leading cause of climate change. We hope to uncover data which demonstrates how changes because of Covid-19 reduced GHG emissions. [GHG emissions during Covid-19](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2021.764294/full) The key elements relating to this topic are finding accurate data which shows the amount of GHG emissions while much of the world was in lockdown because of Covid-19. Some of the key questions relating to this data will be finding which policies and laws directly led to the change in GHG emissions, and analyzing how effective they were at reducing GHG emissions. One of the main economic questions to ask is, how did these restrictions affect the GDP and unemployment rate of countries. Finding the restrictions which caused the lest amount of economic damage while also greatly reducing GHG emissions could lead to ideas mitigating climate change going forward. The main human values within our project are that humans are causing the GHG emissions. Many of the emissions that reduced during lockdown were because people were not traveling as much. The actions and jobs which people take in their everyday lives directly contribute to the emissions data, so this project will also reveal to us what activities people stopped which decreased GHG emissions during Covid-19 lockdown. The values related to GHG emissions are a big part of society. Transportation, factories, and producing food all contribute to emissions. We are not suggesting that completely stopping these parts of life is a good things, but we are analyzing just how much GHG could be eliminated if people made changes to their routines. The drastic changes caused by Covid-19 inadvertently caused many people to decrease their GHG emissions. [Human values and climate change](https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262017534.001.0001/upso-9780262017534-chapter-15) Some tensions that arise are the fact that many people do not have a good memory of being in Covid-19 lockdown. It was a tough time, especially for certain people, and I think there could be hesitancy to try and use some of the policies during this time going forward. This project is not about promoting lockdown in order to stop climate change, it just wants to evaluate data to see how much of a difference the policies made in reducing GHG emissions. Maybe we can learn from these changes and moving forward use the information as a way to decrease GHG emissions. Direct stakeholders in our topic are people who are most affected by climate change. In some parts of the world rising sea levels are displacing people already, and climate change is causing difficulty for farmers. Almost everyone can benefit from learning about what we can do to reduce our GHG emissions, so that we can all live in a sustainable world. [Major Stakeholder in Climate Change](https://www.unep.org/civil-society-engagement/why-civil-society-matters/major-groups-stakeholders) Some skills that are assumed is a small amount of prior knowledge regarding how GHG emissions directly contribute to climate change. This prior knowledge will help frame the overall research motivation. Indirect stakeholders include politicians and businesses. Governments around the world are still trying to figure out the best policies for dealing with climate change. Having more data on how recent policies affected GHG emissions is very useful when thinking about what policies to create in the future. Businesses also feel the negative affects of climate change, and many CEO's want to reduce the amount of emission they have. Looking at data to see how restrictions drastically reduced GHG emissions is of interest to them. Potential benefits are that data can help people make more educated decisions, and can support ideas with real world examples. Benefits could include more informed restrictions which are more effective and narrowly drawn in order to reduce GHG emissions. Harms could arise if decisions are made with data that is not representative. In addition, many people might disagree with the importance of the subject and lack the belief that interventions are necessary. Stakeholders that will benefit is likely people who want to know the truth about GHG emissions. The only stakeholders that could be harmed are people with ideas which are not supported by emissions data.

### Research Questions (JUSTIN + EVERYBODYS QUESTIONS):

_(REMOVE LATER) 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? See the Deign Brief, section B.4. (about 150 words)_

##### TODO (REMOVE LATER):
 [] Piece writing together
 [] Cite Ryan's datasets
 [] Add dataset section for Ryan's datasets

##### Questions (REMOVE LATER):

* MAIN QUESTION: What can we learn from GHG emissions data gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the restrictions and lockdowns put in place to use in the future to effectively help bring down GHG emissions? Did the COVID-19 lockdowns even make a noticeable difference in GHG emissions?

* How did COVID restrictions impact GHG emissions on a state-by-state basis?
   * State policy varied during national lockdown, so this question will be able to explore if different policies across different states had a significant effect on GHG emissions. We will compare data before and after COVID was prevalent to see how the data reflected across different states over the years.

* How did COVID restrictions worldwide affect GHG emissions?
  * The motivation behind this question is to get data from a wide range of countries. Figuring out the restrictions each country had during lockdown and then analyzing there GHG emission data will answer questions about how effective certain restrictions are. This question is important because it also takes into account the difference in cultures around the world. Two countries that had similar policies might have had significantly different changes in GHG emission and much of that could be a result of culture. This question will be addressed by analyzing data from countries across the world with varying economic levels.

* Did COVID make any significant change in the amount of pollution, compared to 'ideal' 0 GHG emissions models? How much pollution was actually prevented compared to pre-pandemic models of pollution?
  * This question mainly serves as a counter-argument to our other questions and will provide some validity to our claims. It will be useful to have a rough idea of how effective we can expect any ideas we come up from evaluating COVID restrictions can reasonably be. We will address this question by directly comparing GHG emission models with real world GHG emission data collected during the pandemic.


* How much GHG emissions have been prevented due to shutdown of factories worldwide?
  * COVID has closed many large industrial centers. It will be valuable to discover what effect their closures have had on global emissions, and can model cleaner manufacturing

### The Dataset (LIAM + EVERYBODYS DATA):

* Who or what is represented in the data?
* What is an observation? What variables are included (and excluded)?  
* Who  collected  the  data?  When?  For  what  purpose?  How  was  the  data  collection  effort
funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money?
* How was the data validated and held secure?  Is it credible and trustworthy?  
* How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data?

EPA Air Emissions Dataset
* This dataset contains approx. 8 millions entries of specific greenhouse gas types, emissions levels and locations across the united states from 2011 to 2020. The dataset was gathered from EPA monitoring systems and devices on the continental United states.

European Environment Agency Industrial Reporting database
* Dataset contains data pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions in participating European countries from 2010-2021, on a national, sector, and facility level. The data was gathered from EEA monitoring systems and devices in participating European countries.

Global Carbon Budget 2021
* The dataset contains fossil fuel emissions (CO2 mainly) dating from 1959 to 2021. Rows from the dataset are in MtC/yr (million tonne of carbon per year), with recorded features being types different ways of emission (Oil, Gas, etc.) and the country of origin. The data was collected from NOAA and a U.S. DOE organization, this data was funded by government programs and as such isn't profit focused. I believe this dataset was created primarily for climate researchers. The data is credible as it comes directly from a scientific journal (Earth System Science Data) and the Global Carbon Project which authored the report which collected and cleaned this data is a partner of United Nation's World Climate Research Programme.

IPCC AR5 WGIII Database
* This dataset contains models from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) dating from 2015. The models used mostly date from 2005-2100 and contain measurements in Mt CO2/yr, Mt CH4/yr, etc. as well as population and GDP estimates, in addition the data is sorted by region ASIA, NA, SA, etc. These models were created from the United Nation's IPCC and as such guarantees that the dataset with created with a non-profit focus, with the purpose of being used in IPCC's annual climate report. This data is credible as it originates from the United Nations.

EPA GHGP Data by Year
* This dataset contains *reported* total greenhouse gas emissions on a yearly basis for locations all across the United States from 2011-2020. The total emissions by year are broken down by different sectors across several sheets (i.e. direct emitters, onshore oil & gas, transmission pipelines, etc.) This dataset was created with the purpose of tracking all reported GHG emissions across the country for the public to view or for anyone who would like to pursue further research with. The data is credible as it was collected by the greenhouse gas reporting program of the environmental protection agency of the United States.

### Expected Implications:
* With the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a decrease/downtrend in total greenhouse gas emissions outputted. The expected implications of this are that policymakers will be able to see that with dramatic global shutdown, minimizing the direct emissions into our atmosphere is very possible on a large scale. The obvious problem however is that life will not be in lockdown forever, but this temporary period may give some insight for a further permanent solution in decreasing emissions. By taking a deeper look into which and where certain emissions experienced drastic change, it may be possible to pinpoint or target a specific area/region to prioritize first for maximum efficiency when trying to tackle the issues.

### Limitations:
* The limitations to this study would be that we can only work with the provided data on record. Also, this data for reported GHG emissions is exactly that: reported. Therefore, although the data is as accurate as we have possible, it is most likely not exactly reflective of the true GHG emissions experienced.
