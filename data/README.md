### Application Programming Interfaces (API) (TODO: Update/delete)

* **New York Times Books API**. The _New York Times_ provides data for Best
Sellers lists and the books that have been reviewed in the New York Times. An overview of the API that we use in our project is available here: [Books API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview). For more about developing apps with New York Times data see: [NYTimes Developers](https://developer.nytimes.com/).

# NOTE 1: About the `/data` Directory

* Use the `/data` directory to store any data that you using in your project (for example, CSV files)
* Edit this `README.md` file and summarize your data files
* If you are using APIs to access data, summarize them, providing specific information
* See examples above.

# NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore,
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
